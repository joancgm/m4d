 ----- set control volumes and coefficients using linear profiles -------

c: cvdcinit .5 0           initialize control volumes as centered
c: cvdcparm alim  0        specify control volume limitations
c: cvdcreset dum dum2 10.  reset control volumes based on convection
c: set_xyzdouble

c: coefinit 3         set up for total, convection, time coefficients
c: coefconv 1         convection to coef 1 using linear profiles
c: coefdt dt 2 n      time to coef 2 using linear space profiles
