# M4D
M4D, a CFD code for calculating steady or unsteady fluid flow - inviscid, laminar, turbulent/transitional. The m4d package includes the c-code, documentation, and working examples. See file **m4d.README.pdf**.

 Upload of the original package, m4d.2015.2 completed Oct 5, 2017. Compiled code and finer grid results from the square channel DNS example are omitted here. 
 Upload Oct 11, 2017, version m4d.2015.2c, Corrections after test on new Mac mini, see **m4d.update.md**. Examples give the same results - and run twice as fast!

**M4D features:**
    Convection adapted control volumes with 3-d 2nd order accurate discetization give naturally stable equations without grid spacing or orthogonality restrictions. Grid for the physics not the numerics.
    The MARV/MARVS Reynolds stress model includes the effects of rotation, curvature, rapid distortion and 'bypass' boundary layer transition.

**History:**
    M4D was first released in May 2015 on our personal website moore64.home.comcast.net. Unfortunately, in late 2015, _**Comcast deleted all personal websites including ours**_.
